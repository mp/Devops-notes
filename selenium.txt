Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool.
It enables users to define and provision a datacenter infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL), or optionally JSON.

Terraform supports a number of cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, VMware vSphere, OpenStack.

Provides a consistent interface to multiple platforms.

Runs through creating terraform instance on AWS free-tier in 2 pages

Configuration file (config.tf):

provider "aws" {
  access_key = "ACCESS_KEY_HERE"
  secret_key = "SECRET_KEY_HERE"
  region     = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-2757f631"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

If you leave out AWS credentials, Terraform will automatically search for saved API credentials (for example, in ~/.aws/credentials) or IAM instance profile credentials. 

Commands:
terraform init		# initialises terraform directory, one off
terraform apply		# like git, shows changes execution plan
terraform show		# show current state

$ terraform show
aws_instance.example:
  id = i-32cf65a8
  ami = ami-2757f631
  availability_zone = us-east-1a
  instance_state = running
  instance_type = t2.micro
