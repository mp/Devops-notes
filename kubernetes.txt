An application container bundle
Starting a single application is quicker than booting an OS, and requires less resources
Creation of pods, dynamic storage provisioning
Multiple availability zones - decentralised architecture (backup zones)
Put it in the zone or region

Kubernetes

Kubernetes (commonly referred to as "K8s") is a system for automating deployment and management of containerized applications. Handles scaling.
The basic scheduling unit in Kubernetes is called a "pod". It adds a higher level of abstraction to containerized components. A pod consists of one or more containers that are guaranteed to be co-located on the host machine and can share resources.[16] Each pod in Kubernetes is assigned a unique (within the cluster) IP address, which allows applications to use ports without the risk of conflict.[17] A pod can define a volume, such as a local disk directory or a network disk, and expose it to the containers in the pod.[18] Pods can be manually managed through the Kubernetes API, or their management can be delegated to a controller.
